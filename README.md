    This is a project born during the summer after my first coding class in university. <br />This is my take on the classic Flappy Bird game, built entirely in Java using the java.awt package.

## About The Project
![flappybirb](https://github.com/cjrussell23/FlappyBirb/assets/81775200/8edeca3b-32cb-40de-b711-387d1ef64361)

FlappyBirb is my personal project, created with a lot of passion and effort during my early days of learning programming. As a fan of classic games and with a newfound interest in coding, I decided to challenge myself by recreating the popular Flappy Bird game.

The game features a simple yet addictive gameplay mechanic where players control a bird by tapping the screen to keep it airborne while avoiding pipes. It may sound simple, but it's surprisingly challenging and fun!

This project not only helped me solidify my understanding of Java programming but also allowed me to explore game development concepts, such as collision detection, game loops, and user input handling. Overall, FlappyBirb holds a special place in my coding journey as it marks the beginning of my exploration into game development.

## Usage

To run the game, you need to have Java installed on your system. You can download the JAR file from the [latest release](https://github.com/cjrussell23/FlappyBirb/releases/download/v1.0.0/Flerppy.Birb.jar).

1. Download the JAR file from the [latest release](https://github.com/cjrussell23/FlappyBirb/releases/download/v1.0.0/Flerppy.Birb.jar).
2. Open Command Prompt and navigate to the directory where you downloaded the JAR file.
3. Run the game by executing the following command:
   ```sh
   java -jar Flerppy.Birb.jar
   ```
